Read the file HANDOFF-FOCUS-BUG-SESSION-2.md and fix the tag autocomplete focus stealing bug.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- You have access to 'puppeteer' MCP server - use it to observe actual app behavior
- The bug: typing in Tags field causes focus to jump to dropdown after each keystroke
- 10+ fixes attempted, all failed (documented in handoff)
- Current attempt (Test #1): Bypassing QCompleter.setModel() - still failing

YOUR TASK:
1. Read HANDOFF-FOCUS-BUG-SESSION-2.md thoroughly
2. Use puppeteer to launch RUN-APP.bat and observe the focus bug
3. Add focus debugging to identify EXACT line where focus is stolen
4. Try Test #2: Explicit focus restoration with processEvents()
5. If that fails, try Test #3: Change event.ignore() to event.accept()
6. If all fails: Nuclear option (replace QCompleter with QMenu)

The handoff document has complete details on:
- Bug symptoms and expected behavior
- All attempted fixes (10+ attempts documented)
- Current code state (src/snippet_editor_dialog.py lines 139-310)
- Debugging strategy with code snippets
- Test cases to verify fix
