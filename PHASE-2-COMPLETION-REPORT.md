## Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Search 200 snippets | <100ms | ~1.2ms |  PASS (83x faster) |
| Search with typos | Works |  Works |  PASS |
| Empty query handling | No crash |  Empty list |  PASS |
| Unicode handling | No crash |  Works |  PASS |
| Special chars | No crash |  Works |  PASS |

**Note:** Search performance significantly exceeds target. 202 snippets searched in ~1.2ms vs 100ms target (83x faster than required).

## Code Coverage Analysis

**Coverage: 98% (50/51 statements)**

### Covered Areas:
-  SearchEngine initialization
-  Search method with query validation
-  Empty/whitespace query handling
-  Multi-field fuzzy matching (name, description, tags, content)
-  Weighted scoring calculation
-  Threshold filtering
-  Result sorting (descending by score)
-  Edge case handling (None values in fields)

### Uncovered Line (1 line):
- Line 163: `return 0.0` - Defensive edge case for snippet with no fields
  - This is acceptable as snippet validation requires name and content
  - Would only trigger with invalid/empty snippet data

**Analysis:** 98% coverage exceeds 95% target. The single uncovered line is a defensive edge case unlikely to occur in practice.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Fuzzy Search with Typo Tolerance
-  Uses `rapidfuzz.fuzz.partial_ratio()` for Levenshtein distance
-  Handles 1-2 character typos (tested: "flsk"’"flask", "pythno"’"python")
-  Supports partial matches
-  Case-insensitive matching

### 2. Multi-Field Search
-  Searches across 4 fields:
  - Name (weight: 3x)
  - Description (weight: 2x)
  - Tags (weight: 2x) - maximum score across all tags
  - Content (weight: 1x)
-  Weighted average scoring
-  Handles None/empty fields gracefully

### 3. Weighted Scoring Algorithm
-  Field weights implemented as constants:
  - `WEIGHT_NAME = 3.0`
  - `WEIGHT_DESCRIPTION = 2.0`
  - `WEIGHT_TAGS = 2.0`
  - `WEIGHT_CONTENT = 1.0`
-  Normalized to 0-100 scale
-  Rounded to 2 decimal places

### 4. Result Filtering and Ranking
-  Threshold filtering (default: 60)
-  Results sorted by score (descending)
-  Returns list of dicts: `[{"snippet": ..., "score": ...}, ...]`

### 5. Edge Case Handling
-  Empty query ’ empty list (no crash)
-  Whitespace-only query ’ empty list
-  No results ’ empty list (no crash)
-  Special characters ’ no crash
-  Unicode characters ’ no crash
-  None fields in snippets ’ handled gracefully

## Code Quality

### Docstrings 

- **Class:** Detailed explanation with usage example
- **Methods:** Google-style with Args, Returns, Examples
- **Constants:** Field weights documented inline

### Code Structure 
- **Constants:** Named constants for weights (no magic numbers)

- **No Duplication:** DRY principle followed
- **Clear Naming:** Self-documenting variable and method names

### Error Handling 
- **Validation:** Empty/whitespace query handling
- **Safety:** Handles None values in all fields
- **Graceful Degradation:** Returns empty list on no matches

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
- `src/search_engine.py` (177 lines)

### Modified Files:

### Existing Files Used:
- `tests/fixtures/search_snippets.yaml` (already created in previous session)
- `src/snippet_manager.py` (dependency from Phase 1)

## Integration with Phase 1

Successfully integrates with Phase 1 (SnippetManager):
-  Accepts `List[Snippet]` from SnippetManager.load()
-  Works with Snippet dataclass (name, description, tags, content)
-  Handles all snippet field types correctly
-  Compatible with Phase 1 test fixtures

## Next Recommended Action

Phase 2 is complete and ready for Phase 3.

**Proceed to Phase 3: Variable Handler (variable_handler.py)**
- Duration: 1.5-2 hours
- Objective: Implement variable detection and substitution logic
- Pattern: `{{variable}}` and `{{variable:default}}`
- Dependencies: Phase 1 complete , Phase 2 complete 
